# CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict vehicle CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on various engine and fuel efficiency features. It provides a reproducible pipeline from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Project Description

Given a dataset of vehicles with features such as engine size, fuel type, consumption metrics, and environmental scores, this project builds a regression(RandomForest regressor) model to predict **CO‚ÇÇ emissions (g/km)**.

## Model

We use a **Random Forest Regressor** from Scikit-learn due to its robustness and performance on structured data. The model demonstrates high accuracy:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 2.55
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 135.46
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.98

## Features Used

- `cylinders`: Number of engine cylinders
- `displ`: Engine displacement (L)
- `city`: Fuel consumption in city driving (L/100 km)
- `highway`: Fuel consumption on highway (L/100 km)
- `comb`: Combined fuel consumption (L/100 km)
- `feScore`: Fuel economy score
- `ghgScore`: Greenhouse gas score
- `year`: Model year

## Exploratory Analysis

- Strong **positive correlation**: `co2` vs `cylinders`, `displ`
- Strong **negative correlation**: `co2` vs `comb`, `city`, `feScore`, `ghgScore`
- Feature importance analysis reveals that **city fuel consumption** is the most important predictor of CO‚ÇÇ emissions.

## Data Preprocessing

- Removed multicollinear features like `feScore` or `ghgScore` (high correlation).
- Converted categorical variables using **Label Encoding** or **One-Hot Encoding** as needed.
- Handled missing or invalid values to prepare the dataset for training.
